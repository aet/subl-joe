# Joe (Joe's Own Editor) keybindings for Sublime Text 2

## Background

This adds the basic keyboard navigation shortcuts of [Joe][1] for [Sublime Text 2][2].

Old habits die hard and so do certain keystrokes that are burned into your spine
for past 20 years..

This is just a quick afternoon hack for getting most of the usually needed features, implementing
a similar search&replace behaviour or block handling would require me to actually get familiar
with ST's plugin model. Patches welcome. :)

## Usage

Copy Default.sublime-keymap to your Packages/User folder
